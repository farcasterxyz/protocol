# Farcaster Protocol

![Archway](/images/arch512.png)

Farcaster is a community-created protocol for building decentralized social applications.

Developers can use Farcaster to build new, decentralized social networks, letting the protocol deal with the hard problems of managing user identities and data. Users can create a new account that they control and sign up to use any of these applications. Users are always in control of their data and identity and can switch freely between applications.

## Getting Started

Farcaster is currently in early beta and user registrations are invite-only to ensure that the network remains stable. A community curated list of Farcaster applications and utilities is available in the [awesome-farcaster](https://github.com/a16z/awesome-farcaster) repository.

Invites can be requested in one of two ways:

1. By messaging [@dwr](https://twitter.com/dwr) on Twitter.
2. By running a [Farcaster Testnet Hub](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo/tree/main/apps/hubble), and posting your peer id in the [dev channel](https://t.me/farcasterdevchat).
